title: 'The force of nature',
contents: "Sudden, fearless and full of energy, the guitar is your instrument of power. You have chosen as your Guitar Hero the legendary Angus Young, who in itself says a lot about you! You can't stand still for a second, you always have something in your hands (probably your guitar) and head (maybe a new solo), but one thing is for sure: when you step on stage you are more energetic than a Super Nova.",
},
'burger': {
title: 'The dreamer',
contents: "With your guitar you love to build real soundscapes, creating a sound that you dream of making school! David Gilmour is the right Guitar Hero for you: apparently cold and detached on stage but who actually hides all the genius of his riffs in those small movements. You are nonconformists, you don't care if you include 5 minutes of solo instrumental in your interpretation, nor even more so if someone doesn't like it. What else to add but a, ' I'll see you on the dark side of the moon '?",
},
'cart': {
title: 'The king of the baroque',
contents: "Unique performers, combine classic aesthetics with rock strength, creating a distinctive sound all your own. Yngwie Malmsteen is definitely your perfect spirit guide! Implacable, technical to the extreme and incredible in the emotional rendering of what he plays, a bit like you who chose him after all. Small suggestion: when you decide to dig grooves on the neck of your Strat to let your fingers slide even faster, protect your eyes well!",
},
'dopey': {
title: 'The workaholic',
contents: "How much work does it take to create a riff or lead that creeps into your head? Perhaps you will spend your whole life answering this question. Slash is certainly the craziest guitarist among those presented, so the parallelism with your whimsical ways is practically perfect! Do you dream of having (or have if you are luckier) the iconic Gibson Les Paul in combo with a tube Marshall that best makes your sound: powerful and decisive, but never predictable. Just be careful not to get attacked by a spectator when you're on stage like your Guitar Hero did a few years ago!",
},
'happy': {
title: 'The wizard of progressive',
contents: "Makers of intricate riffs, blend technical ability with melody in majestic fashion. If you've ever had someone listen to one of your emotional solos and you've seen him cry and who knows maybe tattoo the refrain of the most important piece for him (editor's note: as in my case) the legendary John Petrucci is the Guitar Hero who it's for you! You are expressive, biting and above all you play so well and fast that it seems you have 8 fingers on each hand. Ad maiora and especially remember that ' The Spirit Carries On '..",
},
'nerd': {
title: 'The virtuous',
contents: "Impeccable technique, a combination of technology and talent that takes the guitar to levels never imagined before. One could say many things about Steve Vai, your spirit guide, such as the fact that he is one of the very few guitarists in the world who can play a guitar with 3 necks by himself without the slightest effort, but you certainly know this. And if you are capable of it too well, know that 99% of your guitarist friends will surely be envying you! Technical, never repetitive and with the ability to always renew your compositions, the rosewood frets of your Ibanez Jem are the witnesses."
},
'shy': {
title: 'The master of the strings',
contents: "With your ability and great musical culture you know how to combine the tradition of Italian pop with the energy of rock. Far from the noisy world of international guitarists, on the contrary you prefer to use your great skills with the pentatonic and the harmonic minor scale in our land, a bit like your Guitar Hero Dodi Battaglia, iconic musician of the Pooh. And with all the energy you find, it's appropriate to ask yourself: ' Who will stop the music? '",
},
'sleeping': {
title: 'The visionary',
contents: "Creative geniuses, you probably have a uniquely styled guitar. And probably quite the courage to decide that Brian May, named by Total Guitar the greatest guitarist of all time, is your spirit guide! But then it's not surprising if you know enough: you are intrepid and unconventional, so alternative that like your legend you will have spent years thinking about how to build a guitar that sounds not like the others, rather as if it were an extension of yourself. Little tip: don't do like May who stole your mother's mother-of-pearl buttons to create the fret markers for your homemade guitar, you could get a slipper from your mother's certainly less lenient!",
},
'sleepy': {
title: 'The living legend',
contents: "You dream of influencing generations of artists, building a sound that will indelibly mark the history of music. If your Guitar Hero is the protagonist of the famous graffiti dedicated to him ('Clapton is God') there is very little to say about you: you love blues and jazz and never miss an opportunity to show everyone that yes, you are very talented on the electric guitar, but that when you pick up your acoustic guitar you could literally have the world at your feet!",
